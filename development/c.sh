* complex.h, stdatomic.h, and threads.h are conditional features that implementations are not required to support.
* Normative Addendum 1 (also known as NA1, C94, and C95) is a standardized amendment to the C standard published in 1995 by ISO.
  The amendment was added in order to address the growing international need for international character sets support in C.
  The amendment is formally known as ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (also ISO/IEC 9899 AM1). NA1 added three new headers that added support for wide-characters, wide-strings, and international keyboard.
