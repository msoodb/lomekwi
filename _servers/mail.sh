# A mail server (sometimes called MTA â€“ Mail Transport Agent) is an application that
# is used to transfer mails from one user to another.
# Postfix was designed to be easier to configure as well as more reliable and secure than sendmail,
# and it has become the default mail server on many Linux distributions (e.g. openSUSE).
